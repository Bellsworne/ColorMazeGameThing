# Project Colours

This is a document describing a game jam project internally titled "Project Colours".
It's working title is: 'Prism Path'. 

Project Colours is a colourful and engaging maze adventure game where players
embark on a journey to restore colour and vibrancy to a monochromatic world.
The player controls a character navigating through maze-like levels filled with obstacles,
hazards, and procedurally placed orbs of various colours. By collecting these orbs, the player
unlocks new pathways, overcomes obstacles, and brings colour, vibrancy, and positive life back to the world.
